The  <strong><span>Event::TIMEOUT</span></strong>  flag is ignored when constructing an event: one can either set a timeout  when event is  <em>added</em>  , or not. It is set in the  <span>$what</span>  argument to the callback function when a timeout has occurred. </p> <p class="para">  See also  <a href="http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/libevent-book/Ref4_event.html#_the_event_flags" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;Fast portable non-blocking network programming with Libevent, Working with events, Event flags</a> </p></div>
