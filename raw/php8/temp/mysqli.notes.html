Generally speaking,      <span>mysqlnd</span> will allocate significantly less memory. For      example, if there is a <span>POINT</span>      column in a result set, <span>libmysqlclient</span> may pre-allocate up      to 4GB of RAM although less than 50 bytes are      needed for holding a <span>POINT</span> column in memory. Memory      allocation is much lower, less than 50 bytes, if      using <span>mysqlnd</span>.   </p>  </li> </ol></div>
