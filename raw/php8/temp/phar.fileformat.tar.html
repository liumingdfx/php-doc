<div id="phar.fileformat.tar" class="section">  <h2 class="title">Tar-based phars</h2>  <p class="para">   Archives based on the tar file format follow the more modern USTAR   file format.  The design of the tar file header makes them more efficient   to access than the zip file format, and almost as efficient as the phar   file format.  File names are limited to 255 bytes, including   full path within the phar archive.  There is no limit on the number of files   within a tar-based phar archive.  These archives can fully compressed in   gzip or bzip2 format and still be executed by the Phar extension.  </p>  <p class="para">   There is limited support for reading tarballs in pax interchange format,   but all recognized pax headers (currently, typeflag <span>x</span> and   <span>g</span>) are silently ignored.   There is also limited support for GNU Tar Archives;   currently, <span>././@LongLink</span> headers are resolved.  </p>  <p class="para">   To compress an entire archive, use <span class="function">{@link Phar::compress()}</span>.   To decompress an entire archive, use <span class="function">{@link Phar::decompress()}</span>.  </p> </div>
