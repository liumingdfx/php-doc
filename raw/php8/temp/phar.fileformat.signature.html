<div id="phar.fileformat.signature" class="section"> <h2 class="title">Phar Signature format</h2> <p class="para">  Phars containing a signature always have the signature appended to the  end of the Phar archive after the loader, manifest, and file contents.  The signature formats supported at this time are MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512,  and OPENSSL. </p> <p class="para">  <table class="doctable table">   <caption><strong>Signature format</strong></caption>       <thead>     <tr>      <th>Length in bytes</th>      <th>Description</th>     </tr>    </thead>    <tbody class="tbody">     <tr>      <td>varying</td>      <td>       The actual signature, 20 bytes for an SHA1 signature,       16 bytes for an MD5 signature, 32 bytes for an SHA256 signature,       and 64 bytes for an SHA512 signature.
