<div id="event.persistence" class="chapter"> <h1>About event persistence</h1> <p class="para">  By default, whenever a pending event becomes active (because its file  descriptor is ready to read or write, or because its timeout expires), it  becomes non-pending right before its callback is executed. Thus, to make the  event pending again one may call  <span class="methodname" style="color:#CC7832">{@link Event::add()}</span>  on it again from inside the callback function. </p> <p class="para">  If the  <strong><span>Event::PERSIST</span></strong>  flag is set on an event, however, the event is  <em>persistent</em>  . This means that event remains pending even when its callback is activated.  <span class="methodname" style="color:#CC7832">{@link Event::del()}</span>  method can be called to make it non-pending. </p> <p class="para">  The timeout on a persistent event resets whenever the event&#039;s callback runs.  Thus, if one has an event with flags  <strong><span>Event::READ</span></strong>  <span>|</span>  <strong><span>Event::PERSIST</span></strong>  and a timeout of five seconds, the event will become active: </p> <ol type="1">  <li class="listitem">   <p class="para">    Whenever the socket or file descriptor is ready for reading.   </p>  </li>  <li class="listitem">   <p class="para">    Whenever five seconds have passed since the event last became active.   </p>  </li> </ol> <p class="para">  See also  <a href="http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/libevent-book/Ref4_event.html#_about_event_persistence" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;Fast portable non-blocking network programming with Libevent, About Event Persistence</a> </p></div>
