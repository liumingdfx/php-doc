<div id="phar.fileformat.zip" class="section">  <h2 class="title">Zip-based phars</h2>  <p class="para">   Archives based on the zip file format support several features built into   the zip file format.  Per-file and whole-archive metadata is stored in   the zip file comment and zip archive comment as a serialized string.  Pre-existing   zip comments will be successfully read as a string.  Per-file compression   read/write is supported with zlib DEFLATE compression, and read access is supported   with bzip2 compression.  There is no limit on the number of files   within a zip-based phar archive.  Empty directories are stored in the zip archive   as files with a trailing slash like <span>my/directory/</span>  </p> </div>
