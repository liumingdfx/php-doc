<div id="phar.fileformat.phar" class="section"> <h2 class="title">Phar File Format</h2> <p class="para">  The phar file format is literally laid out as stub/manifest/contents/signature, and  stores the crucial information of what is included in the phar archive in its  <span>manifest</span>. </p> <p class="para">  The Phar manifest is a highly optimized format that allows per-file  specification of file compression, file permissions, and even user-defined  meta-data such as file user or group.  All values greater than 1 byte are stored  in little-endian byte order, with the exception of the API version, which  for historical reasons is stored as 3 nibbles in big-endian order. </p> <p class="para">  All unused flags are reserved for future use, and must not be used  to store custom information.  Use the per-file meta-data facility  to store customized information about particular files. </p> <p class="para">  The basic file format of a Phar archive manifest is as follows: </p> <p class="para"> <table class="doctable table">  <caption><strong>Global Phar manifest format</strong></caption>     <thead>    <tr>     <th>Size in bytes</th>     <th>Description</th>    </tr>   </thead>   <tbody class="tbody">    <tr>     <td>4 bytes</td>     <td>Length of manifest in bytes (1 MB limit)</td>    </tr>    <tr>     <td>4 bytes</td>     <td>Number of files in the Phar</td>    </tr>    <tr>     <td>2 bytes</td>     <td>API version of the Phar manifest (currently 1.0.0)</td>    </tr>    <tr>     <td>4 bytes</td>     <td>Global Phar bitmapped flags</td>    </tr>    <tr>     <td>4 bytes</td>     <td>Length of Phar alias</td>    </tr>    <tr>     <td>??</td>     <td>Phar alias (length based on previous)</td>    </tr>    <tr>     <td>4 bytes</td>     <td>Length of Phar metadata (<span>0</span> for none)</td>    </tr>    <tr>     <td>??</td>     <td>Serialized Phar Meta-data, stored in <span class="function">{@link serialize()}</span> format</td>    </tr>    <tr>     <td>at least 24 * number of entries bytes</td>     <td>entries for each file</td>    </tr>   </tbody>   </table> </p></div>
